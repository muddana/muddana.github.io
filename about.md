I am an experienced software engineer working in the Boston/Cambridge area. My interests are in Programming languages/Compilers and developing other infrastructure tools which help other developers succeed. I consider myself a programming language polyglot and believe in using the right tool for the right job.

I am also interested in use of technology in public/civic spaces. I attend social good hackathons /meetups. I am interested in using technology to see about a social/civic change.

I am originally from the city of Visakhapatnam, a beautiful coastal town in the south-eastern part of India.
