Apart from winning the most innovative award during [HackTrafficking4Good](http://www.hack-traffickingforgood.com/#hack-exploitation-for-good-boston "#HackTrafficking4Good") hackathon organized in Boston. I also received a "hacker choice" award. One of my teammates nominated me for the award. Thanks [Hugo](http://www.hugobowneanderson.com/ "hugo bowne") for nominating me. I was one of the three hackers who received a cool lenovo tablet :
