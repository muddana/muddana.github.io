![Full stack]({{ site.url }}/assets/32643733glasses.JPG "stack")


Top view of a stack of glasses in a tower format. In the begining of my job at Mathworks, I would drink a cup of water and instead of throwing away (there was no recylcing), I collected all of them and stacked them together to form a tower. 
Count the number of levels in the tower!
