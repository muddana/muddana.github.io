On Jan 24, 2016, I paricipated in [HackTrafficking4Good](http://www.hack-traffickingforgood.com/#hack-exploitation-for-good-boston "#HackTrafficking4Good") hackathon organized in Boston. Desite being excited about participating in another hackathon, however, I was a bit skeptical because the theme of the hackathon was a bit grim. Human trafficking is a serious issues, so wasn't sure how/what the hackathon might entail. 

To my surpise, the hackathon was fun. Although the issues to be solved were grim as expected, the enthusiasm in the room was palpable and the impending snowstorm over the weekend did not dampen the spirits. 

I joined a team around noon. We went about to create an intellegent bot to help with the problem of prostitution. An intelligent bot would serve as a helper for law enforcing agents to fight human trafficking. 

Our hack won the **most innovative hack** prize. I was nominated for an induvidual hacker prize by my teammate, which was a nice surprise!

There were talks from various people from various local/regional human trafficking prevention groups. There were talks by Boston mayor [Marthy Walsh](http://www.martywalsh.org/ "Marthy Walsh") and Massachusetts attorney general [Maura Healey](https://twitter.com/MassAGO "Maura Healey").
