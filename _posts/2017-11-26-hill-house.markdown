This is a design of a hill house. The house follows the gradient of the hill. The main entrance of the house is at second level. From the street level at the entrance, only the modest two floors with their long window openings will be visible. The entire house is modeled to look at the view from the hill with large windows and a garden at the second level in the main bedroom balcony. The top most floor has two small bedrooms with extra space for a play. The lowest floor has a open kitchen, living room.
